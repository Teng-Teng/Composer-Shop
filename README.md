### Installing Twig
To use the Twig Templating Engine, you must first install it. The easiest way to install Twig is using composer. (See [Twig Installation](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/installation.html))

Open your Bash Terminal (Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on macOS) and navigate to your Composer-Shop directory. It would look something like this:

** macOS: **
```
cd /Application/MAMP/htdocs/Composer-Shop
```

** Windows: **
```
cd /c/MAMP/htdocs/Composer-Shop
```

Once in the Composer-Shop directory run the following command.

```
composer require twig/twig:~2.0
```
This will create a folder named "vendor" containing all the necessary files for using Twig.
